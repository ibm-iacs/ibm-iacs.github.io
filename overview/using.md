# Hands-on Guides 

Deploying IBM Cloud Pak using this Production Deployment Guide can follows one of these paths:

- [Cluster Infrastructure](../infrastructure/infra-overview.md): Build a **Production Ready** OpenShift cluster. 

- [Quick-start implementation](../quickstart/overview.md): The goal is to get started quickly and stand up a cluster for enablement/demo with no need for customizations. The cluster is typically ready in 2-3 hours.

- [Production Guide deployment](../guides/guides-overview.md): The goal is to customize the deploy a *prescribed* IBM Cloud Pak deployment step-by-step allowing a more customizable approach, while retaining the opinionated configuration from our guide. This approach is suitable for deploying a Production ready cluster, the cluster is typically ready in 1-2 days. 

<!-- - [Advanced customization](#advanced-customization): Although we planned to have more scenarios integrated into the Production Deployment guide, we definitely cannot includes all possible combinations. The goal for the advanced customization is for **you** to build additional components and contribute to the overall Production Deployment guide and the Cloud-native toolkit.   -->
