The Production Deployment Guides have been developed to help customers and IBMers deploy IBM Cloud Paks in to Production on any of the major clouds.

The guides aim to demonstrate how to use Automation and the IBM Cloud Pak capabilities to achieve production level qualities of service, but assume a basic working knowledge of the following technologies:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) version control system
- [Containers](https://opencontainers.org) as the means of delivering applications and services
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) as the container orchestration platform
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) as the kubernetes package manager

Links to additional learning resources can be found in the [resources section](../resources/resources.md).
