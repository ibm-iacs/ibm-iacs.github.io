# Setting up a Local Instance of the Site

<!--- cSpell:ignore linkchecker linkcheckerrc mkdocs mkdoc linenums -->

The site runs under a framework called MkDocs. On this page, you will find information about setting up a local instance of the web site to test your changes before submitting them as a pull request. You will also find information about authoring and formatting your content using Markdown tags and the Mkdocs framework.

There are two alternative methods for running a local instance of the web site:

- Running it inside a Docker container
- Installing the MkDocs software on your local machine and running it there

You can choose either method. The details are described below.

## Local Instance in a Docker Container

You can use a Docker container and run MkDocs from the container, so no local installation is required:

- You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running on your system
- There are helper configurations installed if you have npm from [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) installed.
- Build the development docker container image. This is only needed once if the dependencies have not changed.

    - `npm run dev:build`
    - If this is the first time, you might see an error complaining about a missing "package-lock.json".  If you see that, run "npm install" first and then run the "npm run dev:build"

- To start developing, run the following command in the root directory of the git repo (where **package.json** and **mkdocs.yaml** are located)
    - `npm run dev`

- Open a browser to `http://localhost:8000`, where you will see the documentation site.  This will live update as you save changes to the Markdown files in the docs folder

- To stop developing, run the following command in another terminal window, which will terminate the docker container
    - `npm dev:stop`

- To build the static HTML file and check all links and spelling run the command:
    - `npm test`

- View the scripts section of **package.json** in the root folder of the git repo for additional options available

## Installing MkDocs and Running Locally

You can install MkDocs and associated plugins on your development system and run the tools locally:

- Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org) on your system
- Clone or Fork the documentation repository
- cd into the documentation directory
- Install the required python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Install the spell checker using command `npm cspell`

!!!note
    The `sudo` command may be needed to install globally, depending on your system configuration.

You now have all the tools installed to be able to create the static HTML site from the markdown documents.  The [documentation for MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) provides full instructions for using MkDocs, but the important commands are:

- `mkdocs build` will build the static site.  This must be run in the root directory of the repo, where mkdocs.yml is located
- `mkdocs serve` will build the static site and launch a test server on `http://localhost:8000`.  Every time a document is modified the website will automatically be updated and any browser open will be refreshed to the latest.
- To check links in the built site (`mkdocs build` must be run first), use the linkchecker, with command `npm run dev:links`.  This command should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the **linkcheckerrc** file.
- To check spelling `npm run dev:spell` should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the **cspell.json** file.

The developer guide is created using
[MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org){:target="_blank" .external} with the
[Materials theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/){:target="_blank" .external} theme.

MkDocs takes
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/#what-is-markdown){:target="_blank" .external}
documents and turns them into a static website, that can be accessed from a
filesystem or served from a web server.

A [link checker tool](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/index.html) is
also used to validate all links in the MkDocs generated website.

## Creating Content with MkDocs and Markdown

MkDocs supports standard Markdown syntax and a set Markdown extensions provided
by plugins.  The exact Markdown syntax supported is based on the [python
implementation](https://python-markdown.github.io).

MkDocs is configured using the **mkdocs.yml** file in the root of the git
repository.  For the prototype, the existing Gatsby content is still within the
repository, with the prototype content located in the **mkdocs** directory.

The **mkdoc.yml** file defines the top level navigation for the site.  The level
of indentation is configurable (this requires the theme to support this feature)
with Markdown headings, levels 2 (`##`) and 3 (`###`) being used for the page
navigation on the right of the page.

### Standard Markdown features

The following markdown syntax is used within the documentation

!!!Todo
    Complete the table below

| Syntax | Result
|--------|-----------
|`# Title` | a level 1 heading containing.  You can create up to 6 levels of headings by adding additional `#` characters, so `###` is a level 3 heading
|`**text**` | will display the word ```text``` in **bold**
|`*text*` | will display the word ```text``` in *italic*

HTML can be embedded in Markdown, but in the documentation it is preferred to stick with pure Markdown with the installed extensions.

### Links within MkDocs generated content

MkDocs will warn of any internal broken links, so it is important that links within the documentation are recognized as internal links.

- a link starting with a protocol name, such as http or https, is an external link
- a link starting with `/` is an external link.  This is because MkDocs generated content can be embedded into another web application, so links can point outside of the MkDocs generated site but hosted on the same website
- a link starting with a file name (including the .md extension) or relative directory (../directory/filename.md) is an internal link and will be verified by MkDocs

!!!Information
    Internal links should be to the Markdown file (with .md extension).  When the site is generated the filename will be automatically converted to the correct URL

As part of the build process a linkchecker application will check the generated html site for any broken links.  You can run this linkchecker locally using the instructions.  If any links in the documentation should be excluded from the link checker, such as links to localhost, then they should be added as a regex to the linkcheckerrc file, located in the root folder of the project - see [linkchecker documentation](https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/index.html) for additional information

## Extensions used in the prototype

There are a number of Markdown extensions being used in the prototype.  See the mkdocs.yml file to see which extensions are configured.  The documentation for the extensions can be found [here](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/)

### Link configuration

Links on the page or embedded images can be annotated to control the links and also the appearance of the links:

#### Image

Images are embedded in a page using the standard Markdown syntax `![description](URL)`, but the image can be formatted with [Attribute Lists](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/attr_list/){: target="_blank" .external }.  This is most commonly used to scale an image or center an image, e.g.

```md
![GitHub repo url](images/github-repo-url.png){style="width: 80%" .center }
```

#### External Links

External links can also use attribute lists to control behaviors, such as open in new tab or add a css class attribute to the generated HTML, such as **external** in the example below:

```md
[MkDocs](http://mkdocs.org){: target="_blank" .external }
```

!!!info
    You can use `{: target=_blank}` to create clickable images that launch to another site: `[![Image description](Image URL)](target URL "hover text"){: target=_blank}`

#### YouTube videos

It is possible to embed a YouTube video and have it play in place using pure markdown.  You can use HTML to embed a video:

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V-BFLaPdoPo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```



### Tabs

Content can be organized into a set of horizontal tabs.

```md
=== "Tab 1"
    Hello

=== "Tab 2"
    World
```

produces :

=== "Tab 1"
    Hello

=== "Tab 2"
    World

### Information boxes

The [Admonition](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/){: target="_blank" .external } extension allows you to add themed information boxes using the `!!!` and `???` syntax:

```md
!!! note
    This is a note
```

produces:

!!! note
    This is a note

and

```text
??? note
    This is a note

    You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+`
```

produces a collapsible box:

??? note
    This is a collapsible note

    You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+`

You can override the title of the box by providing a title after the Admonition type.

!!!Example
    You can also nest different components as required

    === "note"
        !!!note
            This is a note

    === "collapsible note"
        ???+note
            This is a note

    === "custom title note"
        !!!note "Sample Title"
            This is a note

    === "Markdown"
        ```md
        !!!Example
            You can also nest different components as required

            === "note"
                !!!note
                    This is a note

            === "collapsible note"
                ???+note
                    This is a note

            === "custom title note"
                !!!note "Sample Title"
                    This is a note
        ```

#### Supported Admonition Classes

The Admonitions supported by the Material theme are :

!!! note
    This is a note

!!! abstract
    This is an abstract

!!! info
    This is an info

!!! tip
    This is a tip

!!! success
    This is a success

!!! question
    This is a question

!!! warning
    This is a warning

!!! failure
    This is a failure

!!! danger
    This is a danger

!!! bug
    This is a bug

!!! example
    This is an example

!!! quote
    This is a quote

### Code blocks

Code blocks allow you to insert code or blocks of text in line or as a block.

To use inline you simply enclose the text using a single back quote **\`**
character. So a command can be included using **\`oc get pods\`** and will
create `oc get pods`

When you want to include a block of code you use a *fence*, which is 3 back
quote character at the start and end of the block.  After the opening quotes you
should also specify the content type contained in the block.

**\`\`\`shell**

**oc get pods**

**\`\`\`**

which will produce:

```shell
oc get pods
```

Notice that the block automatically gets the *copy to clipboard* link to allow easy copy and paste.

Every code block needs to identify the content.  Where there is no content type, then **text** should be used to identify the content as plain text.  Some of the common content types are shown in the table below.  However, a full link of supported content types can be found [here](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/){: target="_blank"}, where the short name in the documentation should be used.

| type | Content
|------|--------
| **shell** | Shell script content
| **powershell** | Windows Power Shell content
| **bat** | Windows batch file (.bat or .cmd files)
| **json** | JSON content
| **yaml** | YAML content
| **markdown** or **md** | Markdown content
| **java** | Java programming language
| **javascript** or **js** | JavaScript programming language
| **typescript** or **ts** | TypeScript programming language
| **text** | Plain text content

#### Advanced highlighting of code blocks

There are some additional features available due to the highlight plugin installed in MkDocs.  Full details can be found in the [MkDocs Materials documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/){: target=_blank}.

#### Line numbers

You can add line numbers to a code block with the **linenums** directive.  You must specify the starting line number, 1 in the example below:

```` md
``` javascript linenums="1"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```
````

creates

``` javascript linenums="1"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```

!!!Info
    The line numbers do not get included when the copy to clipboard link is selected

#### Code highlighting

You can highlight specific lines of code using the **hl_lines** directive.  The line numbers starts at 1 for the first line of code.  If you want multiple lines highlighted, then provide the line numbers separated with a space.  Below lines 1 and 3 are highlighted:

```` md
``` javascript hl_lines="1 3"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```
````

creates

``` javascript hl_lines="1 3"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```

It is possible to combine line number and highlighting.  Below I start the line numbers at 10 and highlight the second line of code:

```` md
``` javascript linenums="10" hl_lines="2"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```
````

creates

``` javascript linenums="10" hl_lines="2"
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
```

### Redirects

To help external sites wanting to link to the documentation there are a number of vanity links maintained using the [redirect plugin](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-redirects/){: target=_blank}.  The links are defined in the **mkdocs.yml** file and documented on the [Additional Resources](../resources/resources.md#linking-to-this-site){: target=_blank} page.

To ensure the auto-generated link page does not get reported by the link checker, an entry needs to be added to the **nofollow** section of the link checker config file, **linkcheckerrc** in the root directory of the project.

E.g. if a link **/help** was created then an entry in the nofollow section should be ```public/help.html$```.

## Spell checking

This project uses [cSpell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell){: target=_blank} to check spelling within the markdown.  The configuration included in the project automatically excludes content in a code block, enclosed in triple back quotes \`\`\`.

The configuration file also specifies that US English is the language used in the documentation, so only US English spellings should be used for words where alternate international English spellings exist.

You can add words to be considered valid either within a markdown document or within the cspell configuration file, **cspell.json**, in the root folder of the documentation repository.

Words defined within a page only apply to that page, but words added to the configuration file apply to the entire project.

### Adding local words

You can add a list of words to be considered valid for spell checking purposes as a comment in a Markdown file.

The comment has a specific format to be picked up by the cSpell tool:

```<!--- cSpell:ignore linkchecker linkcheckerrc mkdocs mkdoc -->```

here the words *linkchecker*, *linkcheckerrc*, *mkdocs* and *mkdoc* are specified as words to be accepted by the spell checker within the file containing the comment.

### Adding global words

The cSpell configuration file **cspell.json** contains a list of words that should always be considered valid when spell checking.  The list of words applies to all files being checked.
