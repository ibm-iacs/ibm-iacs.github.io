**Tutorials**

This section includes tutorials that demonstrate how to build a production level deployment based on GitOps, and add your own customizations as required.

Included are tutorials to create the infrastructure, followed by cloud pak tutorials that show step-by-step how to deploy a cloud pak fully managed by GitOps. The infrastructure tutorials include examples of production ready Red Hat OpenShift clusters for different cloud providers.

Please note, it is not necessary to create a production ready cluster in order to follow the step-by-step cloud pak tutorial.
