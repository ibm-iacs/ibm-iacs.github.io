# Installing services with ArgoCD

## Overview

In the [previous section](gitops-config.md) of this chapter, we used GitOps to
create the ArgoCD applications that installed and managed the `ci`, `tools` and
`dev` namespaces in the cluster.

In this section we're going to complete the installation of all the necessary
services required by our IBM AppConnect Enterprise(ACE) CICD process:

We'll examine these highlighted components in more detail throughout this
section of the tutorial; here's an overview of their function.

* `Tekton` is used for Continuous Integration. Often, the Tekton pipeline will
  perform its changes under a pull-request (PR) to provide an explicit approval
  mechanism or through a push based on the requirements for cluster changes.
* `ArgoCD applications` will be created for each of these resources.
  Specifically, ArgoCD applications will keep the cluster synchronized with the
  application YAML definitions stored in Git.

Note how these application services are installed in the `ci` and `tools`
namespaces we created in the previous topic.

This section will reinforce our understanding of GitOps. We will then be ready
to create ACE applications that use the infrastructure we
previously created and these services we are going to install further.

In this topic, we're going to:

* Deploy services to the cluster using GitOps
* Explore the ArgoCD applications that manage these services
* Review how ArgoCD projects work
* See how `infra` and `services` ArgoCD applications manage the
  **infrastructure** and **services** layers in our architecture.

By the end of this topic we'll have a fully configured cluster which is ready
for us to deploy ACE applications.

## Pre-requisites

Before attempting this section, you must have completed the following tasks:

- You have created an OCP cluster instance.
- You have installed on your local machine the `oc` command that matches the
  version of your cluster.
- You have installed `npm`, `git` and `tree` commands.
- You have completed the [tutorial section](gitops-tekton-argocd.md) to customize the GitOps repository,
  and install ArgoCD.
- You have completed the [tutorial section](gitops-config.md) to create the `ci`, `tools` and `dev`
  namespaces using GitOps.

Please see the previous sections of this guide for information on how to do
these tasks.

## Video Walkthrough

This video demonstrates how to install Tekton. It also shows how to use the
GitOps repository to set up different service related components.

    We'll make extensive use of `sync-wave` when we look at [High
    Availability](../high-availability/overview.md) MQ deployments.

Congratulations! You've installed tekton and configured the key services in the
cluster to support continuous integration and continuous delivery. These have
included services like Sonarqube and Artifactory. We installed them into the `tools`
namespaces we created previously.

This chapter is now complete. In the following chapters, we're going to use
these components to deploy MQ applications and queue managers to the cluster.
