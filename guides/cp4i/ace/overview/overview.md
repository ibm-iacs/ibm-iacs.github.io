## Overview
IBM Cloud Pak for Integration includes a market-leading application integration capability called App Connect Enterprise (ACE). It enables the implementation of API and event-driven integrations and provides extensive adaptation to on-premises and cloud-based applications. It provides tooling that is optimized to the users' skillsets, so that they can be productive in a matter of hours and achieve real results in days. Powerful underlying capabilities facilitate the implementation of even the most complex integration patterns. As a result, data can be moved quickly, accurately and robustly. 

The purpose of this guide is to teach you how to deploy an ACE application on OpenShift Container Platform.  We will be using Cloud Pak for Integration (CP4I) and other cloud native technologies such as containers, operators, microservices, immutable infrastructure and declarative APIs provided by CP4I to create a best-practice based production ready deploy of an ACE message flow.  You will also be exposed to and learn how technologies such as OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton) and  OpenShift Gitops (ArgoCD) integrate in a production environment.
